# Portworx Catalogs for Rancher

Use Portworx to get elastic block storage for containers. Run on any cloud, on-prem, and with any OS. This PX-Developer solution is a free release, offers bare metal performance, and scales up to three servers. 

The PX-Enterprise solution is available and offers enterprise support, scales to 100 servers, and will provide advance features such as encryption. To deploy PX-Enterprise, [contact us](info@portworx.com) for a demo or trial. 

PX-Developer can be deployed on servers that
 1. Provide and consume storage. Servers are then aggregated into a cluster. This is the typical setup.
 2. Only consume storage. These servers are part of a cluster  but  do not contribute storage. Here, launch PX in "head-only" mode.

To use this, do the following:
* Go to the admin tab, then click on settings
* In the catalog section, click "Add Catalog"
* In the Name box, enter `Portworx`
* In the URL box, enter `https://github.com/portworx/rancher`
